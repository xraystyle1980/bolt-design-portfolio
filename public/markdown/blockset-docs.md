#Blockset Docs#
---
##Overview##
###Empowering Developer Success###
Blockset, a blockchain data integration platform, enables engineering teams to build enterprise-grade blockchain applications. To enhance its adoption, the project required a robust documentation platform and a marketing website that could bridge the gap between technical nuance and user onboarding needs.

As Lead Product Designer, I collaborated with BRD's internal design team, external stakeholders, and my team to create a unified documentation site and marketing page. These efforts helped improve developer confidence, streamline integration processes, and elevate Blockset's market presence.

##Approach & Key Contributions##
###Strategic Design Process###
####Information Architecture####
Restructured existing documentation to improve accessibility and logical flow for developers.

####Stakeholder Collaboration####
Integrated feedback from BRD's internal teams and external stakeholders to refine the platform's UX.

####Interactive Features####
Designed engaging tools, such as a pricing slider and feature prototypes, to showcase Blockset's offerings.

####What was the biggest challenge?####
Balancing technical depth with accessibility was our main challenge. We needed to provide comprehensive API documentation while ensuring the content remained approachable for developers at different experience levels.


##Strategy & Execution##
###Collaborative Design Process###
I worked closely with BRD's internal design team, stakeholders, and my team to align on project goals. By conducting usability testing and gathering iterative feedback, we ensured that the design addressed user needs and business objectives.

####Developer-First Approach####
The project prioritized developer tools, such as a sandbox and interactive documentation, to reduce onboarding friction and improve engagement.

####Marketing Integration####
To elevate Blockset's positioning, we designed an interactive and visually compelling website that communicated technical features in an accessible way.

####What worked well?####
The interactive API sandbox proved to be a game-changer, allowing developers to experiment with endpoints before committing to integration. This hands-on approach significantly reduced the time from discovery to implementation.


##Summary##
The Blockset documentation and marketing project illustrates the power of design to align user needs with business goals. By delivering tools that empowered developers and presented Blockset's value clearly, we enhanced the user experience and drove toward measurable business goals.

In a bittersweet twist, after Decent's contributions to the project, Coinbase acquired BRD later in 2021.
